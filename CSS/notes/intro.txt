CSS: 
  CSS stands for cascading styled sheets. These are used to style, design the webpages considering the pages UI and UX. 

  How to connect CSS to HTML?
  There are three kinds of CSS. They are
  i. Inline CSS: This CSS will use 'style' as a attribute to any HTML element and it will assign different properties and values to that element.
   <p style="background-color: blue;color: aliceblue;">Hello</p>

  ii. Internal CSS : sometimes, it's difficult to style each element individually using inline CSS. at that times, to Apply group CSS, we can use , Internal CSS. This CSS will use 'style' as a element(usually defined at end of head)
  it also contains, multiple properties and values to elements

  <style>
        p
        {
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
        }
        body
        {
         background-color: darkkhaki;
        }
    </style>


   iii. External CSS:  it is exactly same as internal CSS but it will be written in separate file with extension .css and we link css to HTML using 'link' tag

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css file link" />


   inline is always powerful and every style overrides its previous style called cascading


   selectors:
   To select the elements we use selectors, There are so many selectors in CSS but basic selectors are three.
   a. tag name : we can select all elements of specific tag name using tag name selectors
     eg: tagname
     {
        properties:values;
     }

   b. class name : class is a attribute to element which is used to identify the element. one element might contain multiple class names and multiple elements may have same class name.
   classes are generally used to identify set of elements
   To select class name , we use dot before classname

  <p class="para para2">para2</p>
  <p class="para">para3</p>
  <p class="para2">para4</p>

   .para{
    background-color: yellow;
    color: black;
    }

  c. id :  To select single element, we use id selector. no two elements will have same id and one element cannot have more than one id. To use id selector, we keep # before id name
  <p class="para" id="chitti">para3</p>

  #chitti{
    background-color: darkorange;
}

 id  > class name > tag name
