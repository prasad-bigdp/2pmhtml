CSS: 
  CSS stands for cascading styled sheets. These are used to style, design the webpages considering the pages UI and UX. 

  How to connect CSS to HTML?
  There are three kinds of CSS. They are
  i. Inline CSS: This CSS will use 'style' as a attribute to any HTML element and it will assign different properties and values to that element.
   <p style="background-color: blue;color: aliceblue;">Hello</p>

  ii. Internal CSS : sometimes, it's difficult to style each element individually using inline CSS. at that times, to Apply group CSS, we can use , Internal CSS. This CSS will use 'style' as a element(usually defined at end of head)
  it also contains, multiple properties and values to elements

  <style>
        p
        {
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
        }
        body
        {
         background-color: darkkhaki;
        }
    </style>


   iii. External CSS:  it is exactly same as internal CSS but it will be written in separate file with extension .css and we link css to HTML using 'link' tag

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css file link" />


   inline is always powerful and every style overrides its previous style called cascading


   selectors:
   To select the elements we use selectors, There are so many selectors in CSS but basic selectors are three.
   a. tag name : we can select all elements of specific tag name using tag name selectors
     eg: tagname
     {
        properties:values;
     }

   b. class name : class is a attribute to element which is used to identify the element. one element might contain multiple class names and multiple elements may have same class name.
   classes are generally used to identify set of elements
   To select class name , we use dot before classname

  <p class="para para2">para2</p>
  <p class="para">para3</p>
  <p class="para2">para4</p>

   .para{
    background-color: yellow;
    color: black;
    }

  c. id :  To select single element, we use id selector. no two elements will have same id and one element cannot have more than one id. To use id selector, we keep # before id name
  <p class="para" id="chitti">para3</p>

  #chitti{
    background-color: darkorange;
}

 id  > class name > tag name

Design :  
     Design of the web page depends on its brand, target audience and context to mention..
     For design, main things to consider are colors, fonts, units 

color: color represents brand and for good design , we have colors like primary, secondary and accent in 60-30-10 ratio. colors can be choosen by 
color wheel or below websites

coolors.com
pallentor.com
realtimecolors.com

Every colors tells a message to human called color theroy.
In CSS , we can mention colors in different ways
  --> colorname : we can directly assign color using its name
  --> RGB : we can assign color by giving values of red, green , blue. each value goes from 0 to 255.
  --> RGBA : we can RGB with some opacity ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 called alpha
  --> Hexcode : we can assign any color using hexa decimal code followed by #
  --> hsl : we can assign colors by using hue, saturation,lightness
  hue -- degree of color in color wheel
  saturation --colors towards the darkness
  lightness  --colors towards the white

  background properties:
     we can give different colors and mix of colors to background using
     
     background: linear-gradient(option, color1,color2....) --> it makes background with mix of colors in linear way . option can be to left,to right, to top, to bottom or some degree
     
     background:radial-gradient(color1,color2..)--> it makes background with mix of colros in circular way. 

     background-image: url('image path') --> it makes an image as background. by default it will repeat
     background-repeat : repeat / no-repeat /repeat-x /repeat-y
     background-position : left/right/center
     background-size : auto/cover/contain


Fonts:
    Fonts also represents brand language. There are basically 5 types of font families are there.
    i. serif: these fonts will have stroke at end of corners
    eg: Times New Roman
    ii. sans-serif : sans-serif fonts will not have stroke at the letter corners
    eg: Arial
    iii. monospace : monospace fonts will have equal width and height with same space like typewriter eg: courier new
    iv. cursive : cursive fonts mimics the hand writing
    v.modern/fantasy : modern or fantasy fonts are used for special effects like titles, animated messages etc..,

How to assign font families in CSS?
   --> we can assign font-families using 'font-family' property directly
   --> we can embed some fonts from google fonts and import them and use them
   ( google fonts --> select font --> get font --> get embed code --> @import)
   --> we can download a font from dafont.com and use them using
    @font-face{
      font-family : familyname;
      src:url('font path');
    }

    font-properties:
    font-family : defines the type of font family and its name
    font-size : defines the size of font
    font-weight: defines the boldness of font( bold/bolder/normal /100-900)
    font-style : defines the style of font(normal/italic/oblique)
                 italic and oblique are similar but italic are cursive in nature
    

    units :
    There are different units to measure the size in css
    px  -- it is the smallest unit of screen. used for smaller units
    % -- it is used to specify % of parent
   vh/vw -- it stands for viewport height and viewport width
