Position: Position is used to move the element on the screen . In CSS, There are 5 positions available
  i. static: By default all elements are static. static will not have any impact of top, left,right or bottom. 
  ii. relative : relative is used to move the elements from its current position. 
     selector{
        position:relative;
        top:20px ; /* moves the element 20px towards bottom from its current position */
     }

  * In case of top:0px , it will not make any impact because it understands like moving 0px from its place

 iii. Absolute : Absolute moves the element based on screen, not the current position. 
      selector{
        position:Absolute;
        top:20px; /* moves the element 20px from the top of screen */
      }
     But it will scroll along with other contents

 iv. Fixed : fixed also moves the element like Absolute but scrolling will not have impact on Fixed. it will be fixed always
       selector{
        position:fixed;
        bottom:0;
        right:0;  /* makes element right bottom corner fixed */
               }

  v.  sticky : sticky is the combination of relative and fixed. it will become fixed when its criteria met and stay until parent is about to over

 selector{
        position:sticky;
        top:0  /* makes element fixed when it reaches top 0  */
               }

inset : inset is a short property used instead of top, left,right,bottom
inset:10px /*all sides 10px*/
inset: 10px 20px 30px 40px /*top right bottom left */

z-index: In case if two elements contains exact absolute position, The one with more z-index will overwrite the other. default Z index is 1
