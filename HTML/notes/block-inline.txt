Block - Inline Elements:
   Basically HTML elements are two types 
   i. container Elements 
   ii. Non-container Elements

i. container Elements: These elements are used to  combine or wrap the multiple other elements as one element such that its designing is easy
eg: <h2>
         <p>Hello</p>
         <a>World</a>
    </h2>
    we can use general elements of containers are div and span

ii. Non Container Elements: These elements are used not to wrap the other elements because they don't have closing tags
eg: img, br , hr etc..,
<img />

what is the difference between div and span?
Based on Presentation of elements, container elements are divided as two types
   a. block Elements
   b. Inline Elements

   a.block element: These element are used to wrap multiple element as single element and present them in new line. They don't allow any other element beside them.

    eg: headings,p,lists
   common block element is 'div'

   b. Inline element: These Elements are used to wrap multiple elements as one element and present them in same line. They allow other element beside them.

   eg: img, a, formatting tags


  Normally, Inline elements cannot have height or width but img tag is an exception

   <h1>Where heart meets <span >art.</span></h1>
