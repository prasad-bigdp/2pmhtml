Forms are used to collect user's data and make user interactive easy. 
eg: contact forms , signup, login, forgot password, email subscribe, feedback etc..,
forms can be inserted into HTML using 'form' tag. form tags contains several input elements as childern. 
  ' input' is a self closing tag which contains following attributes
  placeholder - it is used to make the user understand what needs to be entered in input
  value : it represents value of input that user types or pre defined
  Every input or any other element in HTML will have an unique value called id. Id's of now two elements are sane and also Every element must contain only one ID.

  Every ID can be connected with label using label, for attributer
  <label for="chitti">Enter your name:</label>
    <label for="chitti">Enter your name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="bujji"><br><br>
        <input type="text" id="chitti">

<div>
        <label for="nam">Enter full name: </label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="eg: Durga Prasad etc..," id="nam">
       </div>
       <br>
       <div>
        <label for="em">Enter Email: </label>
        <input type="email" placeholder="eg: xyz@gmail.com etc..," id="em">
       </div><br>
       <div>
        <label for="em">Enter Password: </label>
        <input type="password" placeholder="eg: xyz@gmail.com etc..," id="em">
       </div>

To pass the values to the backend / server, we use action attribute in form
<form action="url" /> 
Each attribute is sent wither as GET or POST request. Enery element/input elements should have 'name' attribute to send the data
  <form method="GET/POST"></form>

GET will mention form details in the URL after form is submitted
POST will not mention form details in the URL after form is submitted

       <fieldset>
        <legend>Login Form</legend>
        <div>
           <label for="em">Enter Email:</label>
           <input type="email" name="em" id="em" />
        </div><br>
        <div>
         <label for="pwd">Enter Password:</label>
           <input type="password" name="pwd" id="pwd" />
        </div><br>
        <button>Login</button>
       </fieldset>
</form>
HTML forms can perform basic validations to input elements using special attributes
    i. required: It makes the input required, so that form will not submit until data is written in it    
    ii. min/max : these attributes are used to specify minimum or maximum value to be entered else it won't submit the form
    iii. minlength or maxlength : These attributes are used to specify minimum length or maximum length of data
    iv. readonly : it is used to make the data readonly so that users cannot edit it
     v. disabled: it is used to make the input disabled so that its data won't be submitted
     vi. pattern: patterns are used to check whether given data is matching with specific regular expression or not. They are also called "regex"

     [] -- it is used for group of characters
     {} -- it is used for length of characters
         {10} -- exact 10 characters
         {10,} -- atleast 10 characters
         {10,20} -- from 10 to 20 characters
    a-z -- lower alphabets, A-Z -- uppercase alphabets , 0-9 -- numbers
    \d is for digits, \w is for words , \c is for characters, \s - space
    [0-9]{10} -- This is pattern for phone numbers
    ^  -- is used for negation
    ? -- it represented o or 1 repeatition
       -- [a-z]? --> no small letters or one small letters
    + -- it represents one or more repeatition
        -- [a-z]+ --> atleast one lowercase
    * -- it represents zero or more repeatition
        -- [a-z]* --> zero or more number of lowercase
    . -- period is used to replace any character
    \ -- used for escaping
