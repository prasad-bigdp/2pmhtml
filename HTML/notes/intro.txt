HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): it is used to create structure / skeleton of the web page.
In HTML everything is made up of tags. Every element of HTML is between open and closed tags.
open tag is similar to <tagname>
closed tag is similar to </tagname>
Complete HTML element contains two other elements such ad head and body
Basically an element is nothing but content between open and closed tags
element = open tag + content + closed tag
<html>
   <head>
      <title></title>
   </head>
   <body>

   </body>
</html>

head is used for the meta data 
body is used for the actual content of the website
HTML is a non case sensitive  Language
In HTML , we can give comments using <!--     and ends with -->

VScode provides some shortcuts to generate template codes called "emmets"

emmet for HTML template code is !+enter or HTML:5+enter
We provide some gap on left side of elements for more readability of code called indentation.for better indentation, we can use extension "prettier"

Attributes: Every HTML element will contain some properties to make them work more efficiently called Attributes
eg:<Human name="prasad" id="214569"></Human>
