    <p>The story of Shin-chan, as depicted in the Crayon Shin-chan manga and anime, is entirely fictional. Shinnosuke Nohara, the main character, is not based on any real person. Yoshito Usui, the creator of the series, stated that Shinnosuke was a character he wanted to be as a child. The series is set in the fictional town of Kasukabe, which is inspired by the real-life town of the same name in Japan. </p>
