Javascript allows events(user actions) to trigger particular function. There are different ways of adding an event to html elements
    i. event handlers: These are properties of HTML elements directly can be added in HTML like onclick
       <h1 onclick="fun()">click me</h1>
       if we click h1 , it calls fun function

    ii. event Listener: eventListeners allows you to add or remove an event and allows us to add or remove multiple triggers to an element. it takes two arguments (event name,callback function).
       const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
btn.addEventListener('click', display)

   Event Listener can handle multiple functions on a single event and also can remove event when it is necessary

There are different types of events in JS such as
    i. mouse events : These events are triggered by user's action using mouse
    eg: mouseover,mouseout,click,dblclick,mouseup,mousedown
    ii. keyboard events: These events are triggered by users's action using keyboard .
    eg:keypress, keyup,keydown .
    'keypress' is deprecated
    iii. form events: These events are triggered by user's actions using form elements like input data, select a value, change a value or submit the form etc..,
    iv. window events: These events are general events such as  page loading, page unloading, resize the page, scroll the page
    eg: resize, load,DOMcontentLoaded,abort,scroll
