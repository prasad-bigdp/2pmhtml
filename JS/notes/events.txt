Events:Events are the user's actions to trigger a function.
Events can be represented in two ways
   i. Event handlers
   ii. Event eventListeners

i. Event Handlers: They are used in HTML as a property of HTML elements. They trigger a function to JS
   <button onclick="fun()">click me </button>
   it triggers JS function "fun"

ii. Event Listeners: They are used to add or remove multiple events or multiple functions triggered by single event.
   const btn = document.getElementById('btn');
   btn.addEventListener('click',fun)
    btn.addEventListener('click',fun2)

    we can call multiple functions by single event and we can even remove those event

Types of Events: 
   There are different types of events in JS such as
   i. Mouse Events : These events are triggered by user mouse actions.
     Eg: click, dblclick,mouseover,mouseup,mousedown,mouseout

   ii. Keyboard Events: These events are triggered by user keyboard actions
     Eg: KeyUp,KeyDown

    iii. form events : These events are triggered by user input actions or form actions
    eg: input, select, change, submit, reset

    iv. window events: These events are triggered by user general actions 
    Eg: scroll,load, DOMcontentLoaded,abort


Event Propogation: Events are always propogated from inner element to outer element . This default behaviour is called Bubbling in Event Propogation

we can reverse the process as from outer to inner called capturing. we can achieve it by making third argument as true in add event Listener
