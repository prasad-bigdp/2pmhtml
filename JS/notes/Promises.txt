Promise : Promises  represents a values that may not be available yet but may or maynot received later
we can create a Promise using 'Promise' constructor

Before Promises, callbacks were used to resolve asynchronous operations. but it leads to the error "callback hell" or "pyramid of Doom"

Every Promise will have three states:
  i. pending
  ii. fulfilled
  iii. rejected

  let mood = "bad";
let P = new Promise(function (resolve,reject)
{ 
    if (mood == "good")
    {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("take 1 lakh"), 5000)    
    }
    else
    {
        setTimeout(() => reject("i don't wanna give"), 5000)    
    }
})

//frontend
P
    .then((res) => console.log(res))
    .catch((err)=>console.log(err))

Promises can be combined with another promises called Promise chaining.Each .then combines with the next .then value.
//another promise
let x = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
{
    resolve(20);
})
//handling the promise
x
    .then((res) => res * 2)
    .then((res) => res * 4)
    .then((res) => console.log(res))
    .catch((err) => console.log(err))


where do we Promises?
   Promises are used in
      a. client - server request and responses
      b. Timers
      c. any function that takes time or not execute immediately

Fetch:
    fetch is the default method provided by browsers which is used for API transactions.  API stands for Application Programming Interface. It Build the gap between frontend and Backend
    To access data through API endPoint or to Post the data to certain end point or to delete,update dat to enpoint, we use 'fetch'.

    The link or url that contains the data is called  "endpoint"

    get data through endpoint
       fetch(endpoint)
