Document Object Model(DOM):
document: Browsers before painting the html code to screen, it converts them into 'document' object which contains tree like structure of HTML code.

each element im tree is called 'node'. it treats JS as object oriented approach where object 'document' handles all elements. 
DOM selection : Elements in DOM tree can be accessed using following methods of 'document' object

   i. getElementsByTagName('tagname'): it is used to select all elements of specific tag name. it selects them as a type of array, 'HTMLCollection'
   const x = document.getElementsByTagName('h2');
    console.log(x[0])

   ii. getElementsByClassName('className'): it is used to select all elements of specific className. it also selects them as a type of array, 'HTMLCollection'
   const y = document.getElementsByClassName('head');
   console.log(y[0])

   iii. getElementById('id name'): it is used to select an element of specific id.
      const z = document.getElementById("myvalue");
       console.log(z)
   
   iv. querySelector('query'): it is used to select any element(first occurence ) using a query . it select only first element matching the query
      const p= document.querySelector('.head');
      console.log(p);

   v. querySelectorAll('query'): it is used to select all elements matching a specific query. 
   const q= document.querySelectorAll('.head');
      console.log(q);

DOM Manipulation:  we can change or manipulate the elements data using following properties of each element.
    i. textContent: it is used to get the text inside the element
    ii. innerText : it is used to get the text inside the element but it also observes CSS. so any element hidden by CSS cannot be seen by innerText.
    iii. innerHTML : it is used to manipulate HTML code inside the element
     iv. value : it is used to access the value of input elements.
     v. style : it is used to change the CSS style of element
     vi. classList : it is used to add or remove or toggle class Names
