AJAX(Asynchronous Javascript): AJAX allows webpages loads the data with reloading the entire page.AJAX allows us to send Requests to the server and display the responses from server without loading the webpage entirely
  Eg: Match score in crickbuzz, cart added feature in ecommerce , function with timers etc..,

How AJAX works?
  1. Request Creation
  2. sent the request to the server
  3. server analyze the request
  3. receive sender's Response


  To understand AJAX in detail,we need to know timers and Proimses

Timers:
   Timers are used to assign a specific time to trigger a function. There are two default timers available in browser
   i. setTimeout(callback fn, time in milliseconds)
         it is used to delay the execution of a function for specific period of time.

         setTimeout(function ()
          {
          console.log("hello")
          }, 0)

   ii. setInterval(callback fn, time in milliseconds)
          it is used to execute the function after every interval
