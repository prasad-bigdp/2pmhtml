Arrays: Arrays are used to store a collection or set of elements.  Here, Arrays are dynamic values. Each and ever element contains unique value called "index"
arr[index] = elements value
In case of out of bound, arrays wil be display"undefined.

Array methods
   There are multiple array default methtods available for basic array operations
   i.length : it is used to return the letter of array
   ii. push(values): it is used to insert the values at the ending of the array
   iii.pop(): it is used to remove the last element of the array
   iv. unshift(values) : it is used to insert values at the starting of the array
   v. shift(): it is used first value of the array
   vi. splice(starting index, deletCount,inserting value)
  splice(2,0,2,4,5,6,7)
  vii. forEach(callback fn(ele,index));
   it is used to iterate throught the array but for cannot return value
   viii.  map(callback fn(ele,index));
    it is used to iterate throught the array but it can return value
    ix. filter(callback fn(element,index)): it is used to filter out only certain values whose condition is true
